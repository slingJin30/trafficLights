# Traffic Light Pro Simulator ðŸš¦âœ¨

An advanced, interactive traffic light simulator built with HTML, Bootstrap 5, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a professional UI, automatic sequencing, pedestrian signals, and special operational modes.

## Features

- **Professional UI with Bootstrap 5:** Clean, responsive, and modern interface.
- **Manual Light Control:** Click buttons (Green, Yellow, Red) to manually change the traffic light.
- **Automatic Sequencing Mode:**
    - Initiates a standard Green -> Yellow -> Red cycle with configurable timings.
    - "Start Auto" and "Stop Auto" controls.
    - Manual controls are disabled during automatic mode.
- **Pedestrian Signal:**
    - Displays "WALK" or "DON'T WALK" synchronized with the traffic light.
    - "WALK" during green, "DON'T WALK" during yellow and red (simplified logic).
- **Special Operational Modes:**
    - **Flashing Yellow:** Caution mode, yellow light flashes.
    - **Flashing Red:** Stop mode (like a 4-way stop), red light flashes.
    - **All Off:** Simulates a power outage, all lights are off.
    - **Resume Normal:** Button to exit special modes and re-enable manual/auto controls.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent experience.
- **Semantic HTML & ARIA:** Structured for accessibility and SEO.
- **Efficient JavaScript:** Modularized code for managing different states and features.
- **CSS Enhancements:** Custom styles complement Bootstrap, including light glow effects and flashing animations.
